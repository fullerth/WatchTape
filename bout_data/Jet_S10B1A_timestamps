I want to talk a bit about the first half. There were 24 jams in that half, we had lead in 12, they got lead in 12. We ended the half with aHUGE 63 point differential, essentially outscoring Harem 2:1. 

Some of that was taking advantage of power jams, but our D to O to D transition was insturmental in stemming the bleeding. 



19:40, nice reform that allows us to get lead
21:50, ivana gets lead, but we get Sketch out by screening to the out on the apex. That's how Sketch was able to have a positive differential without a high lead jammer percentage. Then we get to the front, get together, and force a cut on Ivana.
22:35, Sketch reenters legally after the foremost harem gets an OOP penalty. However, we don't get the jammer lap point here and should have.
25:10, Cia gives Crash offense and gets her out right after Mayhem gets lead. We end up matching points here due to nice offense on Mayhem's second scoring pass.
34:00, The entire 34th minute we draw a cut and give Flex three consecutive untouched passes by keeping harem apart
41:40, I called an OR to try to send Ivana to the box. Even though it wasn't successful I'm proud of this. I was able to phrase the review well enough that it gave our short bench a 3-ish minute rest before the last jam of the half.

1:00:40, we hit terror so hard she calls off the jam even though both jammers are on their first pass
1:01:10, I'm happy with the timing of that timeout. Harem were starting to close the gap. We almost put Ivana on a powerjam with 3 blockers, instead we calmed down and disrupted their run.

My things to work on, the point counting was not fantastic. I need to be better at ensuring all points are counted and they all make it to the scoreboard.
I need to keep better track of our lead jam percentages during the bout, I did not think it was as low as it was. HOWEVER, because we did an amazing job getting our jammers free, we were able to keep a positive differential.
